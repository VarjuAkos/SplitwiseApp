# Splitwise: Event&Expense Management System

## Introduction
The Splitwise application is designed to record and manage events, their participants, and associated expenses. Its core functionality lies in equitably distributing the financial contributions among participants, ensuring everyone pays their fair share. This idea was inspired by the common challenges faced during group events like parties, where tracking individual contributions can be complex.

## Key Features
